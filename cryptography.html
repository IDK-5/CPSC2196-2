						<h3>How is Bitcoin and the Blockchain?</h3>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							In July 1999 Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman said "The Internet would be
							one of
							the major forces in reducing the role of government. One thing that is missing that will
							soon be
							developed is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet, you can transfer funds
							from A
							to B without, A knowing B; or B knowing A" (National Taxpayers Union Foundation, 1999).
							This
							prediction became a reality in 2009 with the release of Bitcoin (BTC) by the
							pseudonymous
							Satoshi Nakamoto (Ammous, 2020).

						<h6><i>Video 1. Milton Fiedman Predicts the future of Cryptocurrencies. </i></h6>
					</div>

					<div>
						<p>
							Cryptocurrencies have the potential to change the way society transfers funds from one
							person to
							another (Mercer, 2019). Because cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, allow someone to transfer
							funds
							over a communications network without the need of Banks, Credit card companies or other
							trusted
							intermediary facilitating the transaction (Ammous, 2018). It also allows individuals to
							take
							control of their money and make payments pseudonymously (Murphy, Murphy and Seitzinger,
							2013).
							Once a transaction is processed, it is impossible to reverse.    
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							However, the pseudonymous and unregulated nature of BTC opens the door to criminals,
							allowing
							them to cryptographically launder, evade taxes, make illegal sales and purchases such as
							drugs
							and firearms; and store the proceeds of crime. BTC is commonly used today by
							cybercriminals to
							blackmail people into paying them using cryptocurrencies. There are some notable
							examples of
							this. In 2017 the WannaCry ransomware attack encrypted a victim's data and gave them 72
							hours to
							pay US$300 to a BTC address to decrypt it, or the cost will rise, and seven days before
							the
							files are lost forever (Ransomware WannaCry: All you need to know | Kaspersky, n.d.).
							Furthermore, an anonymous black-market site on the dark web, known as Silk Road founded
							in 2011
							by Ross Ulbricht (Greenberg, 2020). 
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<p>
							Because a cryptocurrency is transferred from peer-to-peer directly, over a
							communications
							network, and without a trusted intermediary, a person could believe that this form of
							payment
							system is insecure, but, thanks to the blockchain this is not necessarily the case (Yuan
							and
							Wang, 2018). 
						</p>
					</div>

						</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							A Cryptocurrency operates on top of the blockchain, which consists of tens of thousands
							of
							computers around the world called data miners. Data mining is the process of solving
							complex
							mathematical equations with the use of cryptography and regulates the production of new
							bitcoins. Miners verify transactions not formally confirmed by the network (FAQ -
							Bitcoin,
							2020). When the validity of transactions are verified, they are appended to the block
							and become
							part of the blockchain; this becomes the new record of truth (Rosic, 2020). Once a miner
							solves
							the mathematical problem, it updates the ledger and sends it to all the other miners on
							the
							blockchain network.   
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							The blockchain is a decentralised, immutable network; meaning, the storage of data such
							as
							balances and transfers known as the ledger does not occur on a centralised computer or
							database
							(Rosic, 2020). 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							Miners spend a vast amount of energy and processing power to verify the integrity of
							every
							transaction and currently costs around US$6,851 to make one bitcoin and could rise as
							high as
							US12,525 (Keoun, 2020). As of 2020 the reward for adding a block to the blockchain in
							6.25 BTC
							for each added block. That is a staggering US$42,818.75 compared to US$44,043.87 when
							comparing
							it to the US$1,225.17 profit margin; it hardly seems worth it considering the setup
							costs
							(Marquit, 2020).
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							It is impossible to hack the blockchain because of its decentralised, immutable nature.
							Hacking
							it can only be successfully achieved by altering the ledger on fifty-one per cent of all
							miners
							on the blockchain network at precisely the same time. (What Is a 51% Attack? | Binance
							Academy,
							n.d.).    
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							Hacking the blockchain should not be confused with hacking a BTC wallet. A BTC wallet
							can be
							lost, stolen or destroyed and is the owner's responsibility to protect and backup their
							wallets.
							A wallet, not backed up, will become unrecoverable, and in both cases, all their funds
							will also
							be lost and unrecoverable but remain dormant on the Blockchain (FAQ - Bitcoin, 2020).
							There is
							an example of this occurring in 2011 the deletion of Bitomat's wallet.dat file while
							increasing
							their virtual machines ram (Dotson, 2020); that failure caused a loss of 17000 BTC at a
							value of
							US$13 each and at the time a total value of US$221,000. Currently, the BTC is valued at
							US$7047.02 and equates to a total worth of US$120,000,000 (Dotson, 2020). 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							Cryptocurrencies will have both positive and negative impacts on society because
							cybersecurity
							is as much about the user's ability to maintain a safe, secure system, and by following
							good
							security practices (Malan, 2017). These impacts will be primarily dependent on the user
							to
							protect their Cryptographic assets. The user should weigh up the pros and cons before
							choosing a
							cryptocurrency wallet and determine if cryptocurrencies are appropriate for their
							individual
							needs. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							The individual must then take the appropriate measures to maintain the integrity of
							their wallet
							and keep it secure because they will most certainly feel the negative impacts of their
							failure
							to keep those assets secure (Carter, 2017). Some of these measures should most certainly
							involve
							multiple wallet backups, use offline storage to secure the files on physical encrypted
							USB, hard
							drives, and only use encrypted online storage methods (Securing your wallet - Bitcoin,
							2020)(IMPELLI, 2020).
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							There are positives with cryptocurrencies. In the year leading up to 2018, BTC owners
							enjoyed a
							growth rate near one-thousand-eight-hundred per cent (Higgins, 2020). Although BTC fell
							dramatically in the following year to 2019 (Bambrough, 2018), today, BTC is worth
							US$7042.02
							This amount of money is extensive when compared to the United States dollar, but that
							also
							depends how and when a BTC was acquired, and because of the cost of making one BTC is
							close to
							its current value, mining could soon become a financial liability.
						</p>

					<div>
						<p>


							It is hard to determine what the personal effects of cryptocurrencies or Blockchain
							technology
							will be. However, after extensive research, it has become clear that the future of
							Blockchain
							technology is bright. Numerous corporations are such as Banks, governments (Government
							office
							for Science, United Kingdom., 2016) and education institutions are investigating the
							notion that
							they can implement this technology (Raths, 2020). Banks and governments will most
							definitely
							want to govern the use of the blockchain. Education institutions are researching the
							possibility
							that an individuals transcript can be decentralised and accessed and appended to by all
							institutions and organisations. 

						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>

							I want more control of my money, and cryptocurrencies, have the potential to assist in
							achieving
							this financial independence a reality. Thus, having a positive impact when considered
							from that
							point of view. However, I question what affects this will have on my ability to apply
							for
							credit, which makes this transition either out of reach for the majority of the global
							population including myself who rely on credit cards and mortgages to build financial
							and
							security stability. The evidence suggests that there are rewards for investing in
							cryptocurrencies. Like gambling, you win some; you lose some. At this stage in the
							evolution of
							BTC, notably. I would not take the gamble buying into the market, nor would I invest in
							data
							mining. The risks are vast, costs are tremendous, and the negative impacts would be
							financially
							catastrophic.
