								<h3>How has cryptography impacted our lives?</h3>
								<p>In July 1999 Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman said "The Internet would be one of the major forces in reducing the world of government. One thing that is missing that will soon be developed is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B without, A knowing B; or B knowing A"[1]. This prediction became a reality in 2009 with the release of Bitcoin(BTC) by Satoshi Nakamoto. [citation needed]</p>
								<p>Cryptocurrencies have the potential to revolutionise the way society transfers funds from one person to another. [citation needed] Although it is unlikely that it will replace the current fiat currencies, it does have the potential to displace banks as a trusted third party. [citation needed] This is because cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, allow someone to transfer funds over a communications network without the need of Banks and Credit card companies to facilitate them. There is no trusted intermediary processing or recording the transaction. [citation needed] Thus, allowing individuals to make payments anonymously and take back control of their money.</p>
								<p>Because a cryptocurrency is transferred from peer to peer directly, over a communications network, and without a trusted intermediary [citation needed] one would be forgiven for believing that this form of payment system is insecure, but this is not necessarily the case. [citation needed]</p>
								<p>However, the anonymous nature of BTC opens the door to criminals, allowing them to cryptographically store money and use it to make illegal purchases such as firearms and drugs; and is commonly used today by cybercriminals to blackmail people into paying them using bitcoin. There are some notable examples of this; in the 2017 wannacry ransomware attack, where a victim's data was encrypted and given 72 hours to pay US$300 to a bitcoin address to decrypt it.[citation needed] And notably, a drug trafficking site known as Silk Road which; a black market on the dark web founded in 2011 by Ross Ulbricht. [citation needed]</p>
								<p>A Cryptocurrency operates on top of the Blockchain, [citation needed] which consists of tens of thousands of computers around the world called data miners [citation needed] Data miners verify transactions not formally confirmed by the network. When the validity of transactions are verified, they are appended to the block and become part of the Blockchain. [citation needed] The new block then becomes the new record of truth. [citation needed] Data mining is the process of solving complex mathematical equations with the use of cryptography [citation needed] and regulates the production of new bitcoins. [citation needed</p>
								<p>The Bitcoin network is decentralised; meaning, the storage of balances and transfers known as the ledger does not occur on a centralised computer or database. [citation needed] Once a miner solves the mathematical problem, it updates the ledger and sends it to all the other miners on the network. Once a transaction is processed, it is impossible to reverse. [citation needed</p>
								<p>Miners also spend a vast amount of energy and processing power to verify the integrity of every transaction and currently costs around US$6,851 to make one bitcoin and could rise as high as US12,525</p>
								<p>It is impossible to hack the Blockchain because of its decentralised nature. Hacking it can only be successfully achieved by altering the ledger on fifty-one per cent of all miners on the blockchain network at precisely the same time. [citation needed]</p>
								<p>Hacking the Blockchain should not be confused with hacking a BTC wallet. A BTC wallet can be lost, stolen or destroyed and is the owner's responsibility to protect and backup their wallets. A wallet, not backed up, will become unrecoverable and in both cases, all their funds will also be lost and unrecoverable. [citation needed] There is an example of this occurring in 2011 the deletion of Bitomat's wallet.dat file while increasing their virtual machines ram. [citation needed] caused a loss of 17000 BTC at a value of US$13 each and at the time a total value of US$221,000. Currently, the BTC is valued at US$7047.02 and equates to a total worth of US$120,000,000. [citation needed]</p>
								<p>Cryptocurrencies will have both positive and negative impacts on society. Because cybersecurity is as much about the user's ability to maintain a safe a secure system and by following good security practices [citation needed] these impacts will be primarily dependent on the user to protect their Cryptographic assets. The user should weigh up the pros and cons before choosing a cryptocurrency wallet and determine if cryptocurrencies are appropriate for their individual needs. The individual must then take the appropriate measures to maintain the integrity of their wallet and keep it secure because they will most certainly feel the negative impacts of their failure to keep those assets secure.[citation needed] Some of these measures should most certainly involve wallet backups, securing the files on physical encrypted USB and hard drives while avoiding cloud solutions. Use two-factor authentication where applicable and store private keys in a secure format. [citation needed]</p>
								<p>There are instances where not all of these methods are appropriate, such as the desire maintaining one's anonymity, While, current practices recommend two-factor authentication to secure one's accounts, wallets such as Electrum Bitcoin Wallet requires the user to install the google authenticator app on their smartphone. [citation needed] Thus, anonymity becomes irrelevant.</p>
								<p>There are positives with cryptocurrencies. In the year leading up to 2018, BTC owners enjoyed a growth rate near one-thousand-eight-hundred per cent. [citation needed]</p>
								<p>Although BTC fell dramatically in the following year to 2019 one BTC is still worth US$7042.02 This amount of money is extensive when compared to the United States dollar, but that also depends how and when a BTC was acquired, and because of the cost of making one BTC is close to its current value, mining could soon become a financial liability.</p>
								<p>It is hard to determine what the personal effects of cryptocurrencies or Blockchain technology will be. But after extensive research, it has become clear that the future of Blockchain technology is bright. Banks and governments and education institutions are investigating the notion that they can implement this technology. [citation needed] Banks and governments will most definitely want to govern its use which has the potential to cause social debate. Education institutions are researching the possibility that an individuals transcript can be decentralised and accessed and appended to by all institutions and organisations.</p>
								<p>Society wants more control of their money and cryptocurrencies, have the potential to allow achieving this financial independence a reality; this makes me question what affects this will have on an individuals ability to apply for credit, which makes this transition either out of reach for the majority of the global population including myself who are reliant on credit cards and mortgages to build financial stability.</p>
