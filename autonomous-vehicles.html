						<h3>How are autonomous vehicles impacting our lives?</h3>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							When discussing autonomous vehicles, it is imperative to quantify what an autonomous vehicle
							is and the progressive steps within. Fortunately, there is an international standard for
							just this; the SAE J3016 (Imaged below). Currently, the state-of-the-art technology that is
							publicly available is Tesla AutoPilot FSD V.10 running on Tesla self-manufactured Hardware
							V3. (The Tesla Team 2019, para. 1) Present competition to Tesla Autopilot that is publicly
							available truthfully is limited; however, this does not suggest it does not exist.
							Volkswagen, the largest automaker in the world owning brands like Audi, Bugatti and
							Lamborghini are investing 'EUR 44 billion (AUD 77 Billion) by 2023 in the paradigm shift
							toward electric mobility and fully networked, self-driving cars' (Volkswagen, n.d).
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<p>
							There are two main approaches to self-driving cars regarding the onboard instrument. All
							companies have concluded that sophisticated camera arrays and radar are imperative to the
							long-term goal of fully autonomous vehicles; however, the use of LIDAR still up for debate.
							Light Detection and Ranging, LIDAR, 'is a remote sensing method used to examine the surface
							of the Earth' (NOAA 2020) is still very much in development by the likes of Mercedes and
							Volkswagen for the use in autonomous vehicles. Tesla, however, has rejected the technology
							suggesting it is doomed. (Lee T 2019)
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							From a hardware perspective, Nvidia once monopolised the space of autonomous vehicle AI
							chips, 'NVIDIA DRIVE AGX is a scalable, open autonomous vehicle computing platform that
							serves as the brain for autonomous vehicles.' (NVIDIA, n.d) Previously being the only
							hardware platform of its kind, however, this changed in August 2018 when Tesla announced
							they will be moving away from their partnership with Nvidia to develop their own AI chip.
							Tesla made a move for four primary reasons - economics, control of R&D and protection of IP,
							performance, and redundancy reasons, Elon Musk quotes 'any part of this could fail, and the
							car will keep driving' (Hollister S 2019, para. 3).  
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<p>
							The software associated with AutoPilot, being the most advanced on the market, is quite an
							impressive feat of artificial intelligence development. Another example of current Vehicle
							Automation systems is Nissan's Propilot; however, this does not constitute a comparable
							feature set. Tesla AutoPilot Ai drives a rich feature set such as 'lane centring, adaptive
							cruise control, self-parking, the ability to change lanes, navigate autonomously on limited
							access freeways automatically, and the ability to summon the car to and from a garage or
							parking spot'. (Wikipedia, 2020, para. 1)
						</p>

						<h6><i>Figure 2. The SAE J3016 is the international standard for the progression of autonomous vehicles. Ranging from level 0 – level 5</br>
							outlining a clear path of progression to full autonomy (Shutteworth J, 2019).
							</i></h6>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							The current state of autonomous vehicles, due to being the current leader in the space, is
							very much governed by the capabilities of Autopilot V10. Depending on whom you converse with
							the technology is a high level 2, borderline level 3, autonomous vehicle. As we can see in
							the video below (Tesla 2019), Tesla is indeed a certain level 3 autonomous vehicle, however,
							there are unfortunately many instances for various reasons where these level 3 attempts have
							not proceeded as intended. Hence why Tesla vehicles are considered a high level of 2
							borderline level 3 autonomous vehicle.

					<div>
						<p>
							The next steps for the technology allowing it to progress through the relative tiers on the
							way to entirely autonomous vehicles come from many angles. Firstly, for the space in its
							entirety, crucial publicly available competition is imperative. Over time this will result
							in the reducing cost for consumers, allowing for higher levels of R&D budget to be assigned
							and overall bringing a more top quality experience to the consumer for a lower price.
							Leading into the collection of data with live real-world users. Tesla, as off August 2019
							has collected 1 Billion miles of data from users using AutoPilot. (Paolini G, 2019, para 3)
							It is imperative to the R&D associated with the software and hardware driving autonomous
							vehicles. </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							 Another future instrumental step for space will be the vehicle to vehicle communication
							(V2V) and Vehicle-to-everything (V2X). As the names suggest, V2V allows the car to
							understand positioning, direction, velocity, route, traffic, road condition, etc. all
							through a WLAN (Here Mobility, n.d, para. 2) communicating with other vehicles on the road.
							While V2X, it is the communication between the car and everything else. Some examples of
							this are smart pavement, stop signs, guard rales, and so forth. The combination of both V2X
							and V2V provides all vehicles with a much detailed "map" of its surrounds to ensure it is
							making the best calculation. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							Allowing vehicles to communicate with not only other cars, but their surrounds will be
							imperative to autonomous vehicles. It provides a more detailed data set to the vehicle
							improving not only the safety and current experience but enabling the technology to increase
							its functionality set. However, this technology does come at a cost, bandwidth, as both
							operate on a wireless network as the primary backbone for both V2X and V2V it will be
							dependent on technologies such as 5G. 5G will enable significant uplift in bandwidth
							channels to help ensure this technology is feasible and functional without congestion.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							One of the potential impacts associated with autonomous vehicles from a top-level position
							to the consumer is the business strategy of cars as a service (CaaS). Nissan is currently
							investigating this business model launching a subscription service for a selection of their
							range. (Hawkins A 2020, para 1). The autonomous vehicle will have the most significant
							impact on this business model, making it commercially viable due to the great reduction of
							the ongoing cost of ownership associated. Either OEMs or fleet management companies with
							cost agreements to the OEM will be able to leverage this to provide a more affordable
							overall cost of ownership than the consumer purchasing the vehicle outright. The likely
							change of this is more consumers will no longer own their vehicles; however, there will be
							periodic subscription services enabling affordable, safer and more feature-rich modes of
							transportation than currently possible.

							The two significant impacts for the consumer are all the associated safety, practicality and
							features with autonomous vehicles alongside the likely new business strategy to be adopted
							changing the way consumers interact with their vehicles from a finance perspective.

						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							Another potential impact of CaaS is a positive one for the environment. As autonomous
							vehicles slowly progress and take market share, CaaS will continue to grow. Autonomous
							vehicles will have a statistically lower chance of causing accidents combined with the
							higher resource management associated with CaaS. The overall waste from cars should decrease
							and increase the recycling of parts.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<p>
							As autonomous vehicles and CaaS begin to grow, there will be a shift in the workforce
							associated. From a commercial transportation perspective long term, the truck driving
							industry may be revolutionised.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							With the Tesla semi-truck already in the works, there is a very real possibility business
							will start to replace traditional commercial transport with autonomous trucks. Mechanics,
							especially independent, will also see an impact, Tesla requires vehicles to be taken to an
							authorised service centre, like Tesla, Jaguar also require this with the I-Pace. As vehicles
							progress through autonomy and switch to electric, the mechanics' job will require major
							upskilling to now deal with electrical and software issues. However, we should also see
							large intakes of electrical engineers, software engineers and Ai specialists as autonomous
							vehicles begin to become more and more present. Not to mention, businesses will want to be
							leveraging the newfound CaaS business model.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							The personal financial impact could be quite significant, as well as the overall cost of
							ownership especially in combination with CaaS could induce quite a substantial cost saving,
							especially if the service is shared with multiple individuals within the household. Combine
							this with the potential to participate in services such as RoboTaxi it does provide an
							interesting finical outcome for all involved.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							Another factor to consider with autonomous vehicles is if widespread adoption does take
							place the potential impact it can have on our road and transportation network. As autonomous
							vehicles will be able to communicate with each other and their environments, not only will
							there be drastically fewer accidents on the road, but the flow of traffic should also see
							drastic improvements. Suggestions for a potential 35% increase in traffic flow rates through
							corporative driving show a substantial potential positive outcome. (Hyldmar N, He Y, &
							Prorok A 2019) Simply spending fewer times commuting and more times at our desired
							destination is a reality all of us would happily take on.
