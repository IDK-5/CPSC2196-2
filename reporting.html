								<h3>Chrome Extension - IDK-5</h3>
								<p>Cloud computing is at the forefront of Information Technology, making data readily accessible now more than ever. In retrospect, while this statement is correct - it has also made the end-user more convenient for data collection agencies (such as FaceBook, Google, and Apple) to collect information under their end-user licensing agreements or terms of service. The consensus for most people using these sites is to allow them to have access to their data; however, some people would rather have more flexibility and governance over their data and how accessible it is. That’s where our chrome extension at Team #IDK-5 comes into its element.</p>
								<p>We have developed a chrome extension with the intended use to spoof data, save site-specific preferences, and restrict what data is sent to third-party websites and data collection agencies. Our application can review what permissions the site requires and notifies the end-user, which they will be able to toggle on/off. While this may break the functionality of some websites, they can generate spoofed data to ensure that they’re data is secured, while providing data collection agencies misleading data from the end-users.</p>
								<p>We initially have completed our Proof of Concept and completed the initial design phase with a draft template. While focusing heavily on simplifying and delivering a positive experience to the end-user, we wanted to ensure that the application was a simple as possible to use. Reviewing multiple GUI from different google chrome extensions, we used one quite similar to the LastPass UX.</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/app.png" alt="app"/></a>
								<p>One of our concerns is that while this functionality may be sufficient for some sites, other sites will require more specific information such as IP addresses or geo-location data. For this reason, our app would have a paid service option or a “premium service” that includes paid functionality, such as having its own built-in VPN service that can be used for these particular instances. The application has a lot of user-specific functionality, and because of this, we would have a sign-in feature so data is tied to a specific user profile.</p>
								<p>In conclusion, our application will ensure that the end-users will be able to self govern their data and spoof their personally identifiable information on demand. Consumers who are seeking premium functionality would be able to purchase a higher tier of service, which would also include a higher SLA in terms of support and functionality as we stage further developments.</p>
