						<h3>James Walker from Team IDK-5 has an interview with IT Professional - Ivan.</h3>
						<p><strong>Question:</strong> "Can you please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?"</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>No problem, I work as a programmer or developer for a company called Acumen computer systems, and the tools that I use are Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and the languages that I develop in are VB.net, C#, and I use Xamarin as-well. The software that we are working on or improving is a point of sale system and that point of sale system. That point of sale system is sold to retailers, and they have various requirements such as point of sale terminals and also other devices such as iPhone, Tablets and Android devices. One of the challenges is, you're always working with new technologies, especially with Microsoft and you know, it certainly keeps it interesting from day-to-day.</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Question:</strong> "You have briefly mentioned that one of the challenges is working with new technologies. Can you please tell us a little more about what aspects of your work do you find most challenging?"</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>I think the most challenging and you'll probably come across this yourself is that every six months you have to learn new technology that comes out. Every six months Microsoft depreciates old technology, comes up with some new ideas new technology then you have to start fresh and start learning again which is exciting in many cases, but it's also challenging as well because a lot of time Microsoft doesn't have the appropriate documentation or examples to try and educate the users out there in the community how to use these tools. So yeah, in many cases like that it is just trial and error to figure out how things work and what you're supposed to do. So yeah, they are the challenges.</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>James:</strong> That would be difficult, not having a manual to refer too.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>Well, you do use manuals, but the manuals from a developer's perspective are poorly written. I think Microsoft needs to change that a little bit because it's challenging and more complicated than it should be. But yeah, they are some of the difficulties for you.</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Question:</strong> "Is there any other work within your role that you have to do besides programming?"</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>No not at the moment, not in this job. Simply just, programming makes it nice and easy.</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Question:</strong> "What about in previous jobs that you've had?"</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>Well, in previous jobs, I was an IT Manager a software development manager and once again programmer and also IT technical support manager, so I have worked right across the breadth of IT.</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Question:</strong> "You mentioned were a software development manager. Is that a position that still requires you to code? Or is it more of a supervisory role where you oversee the project to make sure it is coming together according to the project plan?"</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>Yeah, it's more project management, making sure all the developers follow the same coding standards and making sure the delivery is on time. Because when you have a large software development project, there are many aspects or many components within the development. And if you've got a large development team, you need to make sure that everyone's developing at the same rates and things get developed on time, and no people are sitting around doing nothing. So, managing teams managing the development, project developments and making sure that your reporting of progress with a client is timely and something that you have agreed on as well. Communication is one of the most significant aspects of any sort of management role. You need to make sure you communicate well to your superiors, your clients and you also need to communicate down the tree to your developers to make sure they know what the objectives are, what needs to be completed and by when.</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Question:</strong> "Can you tell us about the different people that you have interactions with?"</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>In my present role, I indeed interact with the business owner and the help desk support team and the other members of the development team. It is a relatively small shop, so the interactions are on a lot more personal level, we can call each other and talk about things that you wouldn't usually talk about in a broader development environment.</i>
						</p>
						<p><i>In my previous role, you need to be able to communicate well with business owners, senior managers, The stakeholders because they are funding the work and you need to make sure you keep everyone up to date. You need to put together project plans, communication plans and delivery plans as well. So, there is a fair amount of work when you're in a management role, and it's all about communication to make sure all the stakeholders top to bottom know precisely what's happening and when and you need to conduct regular project planning meetings because projects do change. The scope of the work always changes, so having regular meetings to update all the stakeholders is very important.</i></p>
						<p><strong>Question:</strong> "Can you tell us about other interactions you have with other IT professionals?"</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>Can you give me an example?</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>James:</strong> When you are working on a project with other IT professionals' whether it is one or many, and whether they're programmers or help desk support. What do you talk about, and how do you go about planning?</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>The interactions that I generally try and follow is to stay open. I like to keep an open mind because everyone's got skill and knowledge and never be of the opinion that you know everything or you know best. Because that is never the case, so when you go and talk to people and ask for their opinion or advice, they are more than happy to give it. Much of the time they give good advice which is helpful with the development process. Because, unless you talk to people and find out specifics about certain ways of doing things you could head in the wrong direction with the project as well, so it is imperative to interact with people in the team ask for their opinion, it doesn't matter if they are senior developers or junior because everyone's had a different experience. The other thing also, it helps bond the team as well when you have an open mind and have an open form of communication. It bonds the team, makes everyone a part of the team, and as a result, they perform better and put in extra time as well in order to achieve the common goal and the results. You can do it more systematically. You can have team meetings, and a ask everyone to talk about how they are progressing with their part of the project, I think that a lot of the time it's a waste of time it puts undue pressure on the junior developers because they are not that well experienced and they struggle sometimes. So a good manager or development manager will identify that straight away and offer to assist them whether that's in the form of training, the allocation of a senior member to assist them in their work; because at the end of the day you are all working towards the same result, to complete the project. Everyone has to pull their weight, and from a manager's perspective, you need to be able to understand your people, their skill level. If someone is short on a particular skill, you need to improve that skill reasonably quickly, and everyone appreciates that as well. So yeah, you can do formal or informal interactions, in fact, a lot of times it is best to do both. Have a formal meeting, not too frequent. Then informal, where the manager just individually goes and talks to people as they are working just to sound them out, see how they're going, see if they are struggling with anything and offer any sort of support that they need.</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Question:</strong> "Do you currently or have you had interactions with investors in the past?"</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>Yeah, a bit, they are the stakeholders. The senior stakeholders like I said, sometimes it's not the direct investor they facilitate or find the investors or business owners who are paying for the work. You need to communicate with them regularly on how the project is going from a completion point of view. Whether you're ahead, behind, or need more resources. Resources can be more computers, more people, hiring consultants, extra training for staff. There is a wide variety of requirements that an investor may need to provide to have the project completed, and the sooner you advise them of that, the better it is. That allows them to make a quick decision on whether to proceed or to abandon the project as-well if it ends up costing them too much. So, communication is vital.</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>James:</strong> My understanding based on what you have told me is that communication is paramount and is one of the essential aspects of project development.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>Communication is essential because, as an individual, you cannot feasible complete all the work on time. You need other people to assist, whether that is junior programmers so you can sort of shunt off some of the work to help them fast track the completion of the project or whether it's asking the stakeholders to provide more funds to get more developers so that once again you can fast track the development work. Because there is always a timeline for various reasons. A lot of the software projects have a critical delivery timeline because you've got competitors in the market that may already be doing, let's say a web system or web e-commerce system. If you don't have one as an example to compete with them, you could potentially go out of business fairly soon. You'd lose a lot of money, so there are critical business timelines that need to be met, and financiers or the stakeholders are aware of those critical timelines. They will communicate that to the IT managers and Software Development managers, and they will provide resources, whether its money, people or anything like that too fast track the development. So, communicating from, top to bottom, bottom to top is very important. But communications,  there are many ways to communicate, and that's one of the things that you'll find out. One is verbal, where just talk to them and if the financiers or stakeholders are open to that; then you do that. You ask them how they would like to communicate. You can do it via email, but you can also do it in a formal way as well because what you'll find is sometimes more than one client or stakeholder that wants this software. You need to communicate the same message to all of them at the same time. You need to arrange a meeting, put together PowerPoint presentations and present that on a screen so they can all follow, this way everyone keeps on track as to how the delivery of the software project is proceeding. Then once you have established communication with them, they will give you instructions out of that meeting or guidelines or more resources, you then need to communicate that back down the tree with your team. That's project leaders, software developers, whether it's a senior or junior, you need to communicate that back down because they need to know what their next steps are and why. So once again, you can do that either verbally or individually. Once you have got that stakeholder communications, it's much better to do that as part of a team and once again use the PowerPoint presentation so everyone can follow. You can talk about the points clearly and then communicate from the senior team down to your team to make sure that everyone is on the same page.</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Question:</strong> "Is there anything in particular that you enjoy about your job?"</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>Yeah, there is, the first this is that it is easy. The second thing is that it is not stressful. The third thing is that you are always delivering something. Number four, technology is always changing, well not always but quite frequently, so you're always playing with new toys. And, I do enjoy coding because it's almost like a detective theme behind coding because you don't know to do something until you actually go and do it and then you have to start thinking, ok, how will I achieve this? I know how the screens will look but what about behind the screens. How should the coding work behind the screens? In other words, if someone keys a bit of data into a field, what is supposed to happen to that data? Do you verify it? Do you change colours on the screen? Do you send an email to a client, do you print it out? There is a whole heap of things that could happen. Sort of a bit of a mystery thriller or novel where it's never the same, you always have to think through what the next step is and from that point of view, not knowing and then trying to figure out how to do things, I do find exciting. I don't get bored. Look sometimes; you do get bored because you have to do some of the mundane work as well but a lot of the time its new stuff its new ways of doing things and I do find it exciting and relatively easy to do.</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>James:</strong> Fantastic, I am excited by programming too. I enjoy the same sort of thing. I love the problem-solving aspect and getting something to work when I have an idea.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>Well, that's exactly right! It's nice to develop thing because you're actually creating something, and you can see it develop. You can see the end result, and then you can sell it, provide it to the stakeholders or the clients, and hopefully, they like what they see, and if not, you go back to the drawing board, make a few changes and before you know, it's out there in the marketplace doing what it's supposed to do which is nice.</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Question:</strong> "Are there separate people designing the software should look, or are the developers taking care of that too?"</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>Yeah, we do that as well ourselves. Generally, the people or the clients that request something like that, have a broad visual idea of what it is supposed to do or how it should look. There is never an exact idea and even if they did, to try and put it all down on paper, it is time-consuming and in the end, whatever they put on paper ends up changing because they can't think of everything and many times when you get partway through the project, you present it to them and what they have asked for, and even if you have done as they've asked they say "well maybe not,  somethings changed. We don't want it to look like that, can we change it this way? We think it will look better!" And you get a lot of that during the development process and the design process. So, I think from our aspect, if we get an initial design, just a sketch and if that is sufficient, we will create something and let the client have a look at it if they like it great! If not, then they will tell us then, "Can we change it a little bit?" then we go ahead and change it. So, it's sort of like an iterative process; you go backward and forwards until the client is happy and you move on to the rest of the system.</i>
						</p>
						<p><i>So, we don't have any designers at the moment. I think the company is too small to employ designers. So, the developers do the actual designing and coding from the client's initial requests and requirements. A lot of the time, those requests are just one sentence or paragraph, so you don't have much to go on. And if you do just get a one-liner, then we have to go back to the client and say what about this or what about that so prompt them to provide more information so that we have enough to go away and build something. And what you find is, clients generally have an idea, and it's just a high-level idea, they don't have the detail, they don't even think about colours for example or graphics on the screen. They don't think about the functionality and how the screen will work. For instance, if you key something in one field, where's the cursor supposed to go? Nowhere, or is it supposed to go to the next field? Or the field across to the left, or the field across to the right, or is it supposed to display something on the status line. Those sorts of things are very trivial to stakeholders or people asking for the product, and so we need to prompt them if we think it a critical part of the application and just to get some sort of agreement from them to make sure we don't do extra work that is not required.</i></p>
						<p><strong>James:</strong> That would sort of come into the idea of user experience, the small details like that, wouldn't it?</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>Well yeah, that's right. The stakeholders and the people that generally request these systems and provide all the resources like finances. They're not the ones that ultimately want the system. It might be one of their sub-ordinances, like the tellers at a branch might be asking for a small system to help them in the branch as an example. So, they would have to communicate with their managers. They will then have to communicate to the senior manager who is responsible for financing the communicates with the IT department. There is a big chain, but it all depends on which company you work for. If you work in a large corporation like a bank, that's how it works. If you work in a small company like I am in at the moment, you basically deal directly with the clients like the retail shop owners, whether they are the actual owner or one of the managers in that retail store. So, it's a far flatter communication structure than if you're working for a large bank.</i>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Question:</strong> "Are you able to share an example of work that you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?"</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>It's an ever-changing industry! To give an example, If you are a Mathematician or a Scientist, Mathematics never changes. It is the same. Same as a chemist, the chemistry doesn't change. And that is the same with Engineers, whether a mechanical or electrical engineer, it stays the same. With the IT industry, everything changes within a space of six to twelve months. And that's not only programming languages, the tools that are used but also the methodologies that you use. As an example, development methodologies, we went from waterfall to agile, to lean. Who knows what they use now? There is a whole heap of methodologies that come and go very quickly in the industry. And likewise, with all the tools, so for me, What captures the essence of IT is that it is ever-evolving and ever-changing, and it is changing very quickly. To be on top, in IT you always have to be using the new technology, you always have to be learning the new technology because that's where the essence of IT is.</i>
						</p>
						<p><i>For instance, in the 1980s, I learned Fortran, and there are not many organisations today that use Fortran. Same with Cobol, not many organisations use Cobol these days. So, unless you continually evolve your skills and toolset, you'll be left behind. So, if Microsoft and IBM come up with new tools and products, you must jump on board, learn those products, stay abreast of the technology to stay current and also for you as an individual to be part of that industry; otherwise, you will be left behind. And that goes from the programmer's point of view the technical support that deals with servers and networking. There is new technology coming out every day. To the software development managers and the IT managers, every aspect of IT changes on a very short time scale, six to twelve months, and you must be informed. You must educate yourself whether that's private, whether that's training courses whether it's just reading books, But you must do it to stay current.</i></p>
						<p><i>So yeah, that's my example of work that captures the essence of IT.</i></p>
						<p><strong>James:</strong> Ivan, Thank you so much for committing your precious time to assist us with some insight into what you do. It has been a pleasure talking with you.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ivan:</strong>
							<i>Likewise, James. I wish your team all the best in the future.</i>
