						<h3>Ideal Job Titles</h3>
						<p>As a group, we have reviewed the Burning Glass data and compared it with our team's career aspirations. Due to the unique nature of some of these jobs, it was difficult to find data which directly identified them. That was having been said; due to the management nature of Jacob and Beau's jobs, in particular, it is entirely possible that they're not actively advertised. Therefore, we have done our best to assess them with the data we have found.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Beau Dean: Project / Implementations Manager in Microsoft Cloud Solutions</li>
							<li>Jacob Depares: IT Director</li>
							<li>James Walker: Control Systems Engineer</li>
							<li>Larissa Hennessey: Software Engineer</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Below is a graph representing the demand for the team's jobs in comparison with one another. Each job position is rated using the number of active job posts present in the Burning Glass data. The fact that these jobs even ranked is enough to say that there is a reasonable demand for them.</p>

						<h3>IT Specific Skills</h3>
						<p>Since reviewing the group's required skillsets for their ideal jobs, we have composed a graph to list them against current demand. There was a total of ten skills removed from the chart which were required by multiple team members but had no demand and could suggest they are niche skills.</p>
						<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images\in-demand.png" alt="in-demand" /></a>
						<h3>General Skills</h3>
						<p>Upon analysis of what falls under general skills in the Burning Glass data, there are quite a few skills which overlap or that the team already utilises in their day to day jobs. The team already holds a large number of these requirements, indicating an ability to dedicate more time to achieving their IT-driven skills.</p>
						<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images\skills-demand.png" alt="demand" /></a>
						<h3>Review</h3>
						<p>Overall, the team at IDK-5 has a vast number of required skills both generally and within the IT-specific range; however, there are, of course, some missing. The IT industry is vast and not every skill in it is documented within this data, as previously discussed. Several IT skills are niche requirements for Larissa and James' ideal jobs while several skills in the general skills field either overlap or deemed common sense. In terms of IT-specific skills, the three highest-ranked skills that our team did not possess was Structure Query Language (SQL), SAP and graphic design. These skills, when ranked out of the twenty-five listed, came in at first, fifth and tenth respectively. While the direction of one's career is entirely up to them, this has made our group reconsider what paths to take in their future in order to make themselves as employable as possible. Throughout our assignment and in conjunction with a review of our team's collective skills, it has become quite clear that we are lack of creativity and decision making, which are ranked ninth and twenty-fifth, respectively. While the team is aware, the assessment requested our three missing skills; collectively, the team has agreed that the remainder of the skills are either common sense or overlapping with our previously attained skills.</p>
						<h3>Personal Reviews</h3>
						<p>Below are the personal reviewed opinions of each team member regarding their skill sets and opinions of their ideal jobs after being presented with the relevant Burning Glass data.</p>
						<h3>Beau</h3>
						<p>Reviewing the gathered information from Burning Glass, I feel that my ideal job is ideally suited to my expertise and interpersonal skills. Recent global events with COVID-19, Working from Home solutions have exploded as a job requirement only concreting future cloud solutions, and my desire to develop my skillset for my ideal job.</p>
						<h3>Jacob</h3>
						<p>By completing my Bachelors in IT this will both provide me with the qualifications needed and improve my knowledge across the field of IT from both a technical and industry practice perspective. I’m fortunate to already be working in the industry and can grow my experience leading international projects for a company enhancing my leadership and strategic skills. Overall, through my education and current career part I believe I’m positioning myself to take up such roles in the future. Therefore, my opinion regarding my ideal job has not changed.</p>
						<h3>James</h3>
						<p>After Analysing the burning glass data, I have taken some time to reflect on where I stand in regards to my individual career choices. Although it appears that my position of choice is more of a niche one, I am incredibly passionate about developing software. My main goal moving forward is to build software that will make a positive impact on society, save families money, and help them to achieve their goals. I can approach this idea in many ways. Thus, I am open to many different position titles or career paths within Information Technology. Still, the essence of what I want to spend the rest of my working life doing will always remain the same.</p>
						<h3>Larissa</h3><p>"Whilst my desire to become a software engineer hasn’t changed due to the Burning Glass data, my aspirations have changed after having written my essay. Up until recently I was not aware of the work being performed to create bionic limbs and neural links. Having seen the difference that it can make in the lives of many, including some of the women I work with, I’ve decided that to consider my options in moving into Bionics. Whether this means working as a Systems or Software Engineer to design the computer that calculate actions, real-time problem solving or hardware tension."</p>
