							<h2>Team Composition</h2>
							<p><strong>Just who is Team #IDK-5?</strong></p>
							<p><i>Team IDK-5 started as a team of five individuals with an idea. A great idea, yet we had no idea what to call it. We all said, "I don't know.", so we named ourselves the "IDK-5" team. Shortly, following the founding of our Team, we were down to four people. Focusing on our solutions, we decided to leave the name as IDK-5, with the collaborative goal in mind, that we give 120% to everything that we did.</i></p>
