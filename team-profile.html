							<h2>Team Profile</h2>
							<p>To identify our team’s strengths and weaknesses, we’ve utilised personality tests such as Myer-Briggs, OCEAN and a Learning Style test. This testing has also allowed us to identify any possible personality clashes and make active efforts to prevent them before it causes tension within the team. Team unity is of utmost importance to us.</p>

								<h3>Myer Briggs</h3>
								<p>This test divides the personality of each person down into a variety of categories. Below is a graph for convenience in comparing the members of our team.</p>
								<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images\myer-briggs.jpg" alt="myer-briggs"></a>
								<p>A glance at these results would have the average person believing that our team is somewhat unbalanced, but fortunately, this is not the case. Whereas usually, an introverted team would struggle to complete a task such as a presentation or an interview, our outlier extrovert James would excel. It is through this logic that we came together and assigned our project roles based upon knowledge and suited personality traits. Our team’s deficits and surfeits balance each other out in the long game.</p>
								<h3>Learning Style</h3>
								<p>Our learning style tests broke down our personal preferences into the categories of tactile, auditory and visual before presenting them as a percentile. As evidenced by the pie chart below, our group is incredibly well balanced, with only a slight preference in a tactile approach to learning. These learning style variations will be of immense help when researching and developing our application.</p>

								<h3>OCEAN</h3>
								<p>The OCEAN test is similar to the Myer-Briggs in the way that it breaks down personalities, although this time geared more towards functionality in a workplace. It evaluates (O)penness, (C)onscientiousness, (E)xtraversion, (A)greeableness and (N)euroticism. This test is perhaps the most important as it can address differences in the team and plan for how to overcome them. Similar to the results of the previous tests, our team can somewhat balance each other out.</p>
								<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images\ocean.jpg" alt="ocean"></a>
								<h3>Future Ideals</h3>
								<p>As evident in the introduction of our team members, everyone has very different long-term plans for the future. From IT industry leaders to software development and advanced machine learning, it’s clear that there is little that would generally unite a group like this. Fortunately, all of these jobs have one common thread, and that is the interest in software engineering. This is the thread that binds them together in the pursuit of a more privatized idea of web browsing.</p>
