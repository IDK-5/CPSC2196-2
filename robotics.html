							<h3>How is Machine Learning improving our lives?</h3>
							<p>At present, robotics is defined as the design, creation, operation and automation of machines (Merriam-Webster Incorporated, 2020). This industry can be divided clearly into two main branches of industry and innovation. Industry focuses on the movement to automate the more dangerous jobs involved in manufacturing to reduces injuries, fatalities and insurance premiums. In contrast, the second branch of innovation is the movement to test the capabilities of creation to create an autonomous or sentient being. In essence, it is humanities effort to play god in their respect. This essay is innovation-focused.</p>
							<p>At this present time, state of the art robotics focuses mostly on the creation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning functionality and Bionics. The masterworks currently being done in these fields all have one thing in common, and that is the desire to replicate vital human functions.</p>
							<p>Efforts to create agile and calculative robots such as the nimble robotic hands created by Open AI (Wiggers, 2018), the terrain traipsing Atlas from Boston Dynamics (Markoff, 2013) and the bionic limbs of the MIT Center of Extreme Bionics (Herr, 2014) have all significantly advanced the understanding of human function. To date, they are yet to close the divide between biotic and robotic, meaning that there is room for further development.</p>
							<p>Perhaps one of the most significant scientific undertakings at the moment is the aim to create and implant a functional neural link to utilize the inactive parts of the human brain. The current project NeuralLink project launched by one of the Tesla founder Elon Musk has brought a spotlight on this technology and created a demand for competent staff from a variety of specialties to develop it further (Lopatto, 2019).</p>
							<p>In the future, humanities next significant objective will likely be to make sophisticated neural links available to the masses to help the population achieve its unrecognized processing potential. Currently, the first examples are only available to people with hearing aids or Parkinson's patients with deep brain stimulation implants (The Michael J Fox Foundation, 2020). The developments to date have significantly reduced the size and invasive nature of this device.</p>
							<p>It is believed that through tissue sculpting and a shift in the amputation methods utilized globally, within the next few years, MIT will be able to create artificial proprioceptive joints and refine neurological embodiment. This process is still in trial stages but already shows promising results (Herr, 2018). It is from this point that once consistent neurological embodiment is achieved, the need for a brain-machine interface (BMI) to action the limb will become somewhat unnecessary.</p>
							<p>In regards to the development of autonomous individual robotic units, advances in intelligent hardware functions which have taken place this year alone have cut image recognition time by a significant magnitude. This will enable future robots to analyses their obstacles quicker and have real-time reflexes (Vienna Institute of Technology , 2020). Although this seems like a small step, were this combined with the work being done by Boston Dynamics, it would create a search and rescue robot capable of evaluating hazards and risk in real-time, enhancing the capabilities of it to save lives if it were deployed.</p>
							<p>Were robotics to undergo this sort of rapid development within the next few years, it would open up doors in countless other industries. The Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) being implemented at the Boston Children's Hospital in the past year, learning how to do heart surgery, is a prime example (Svoboda, 2019). It is estimated that over time as it is taught more complex procedures requiring nanometer correct accuracy, it could save the 200,000 lives lost annually in the United States of America due to physician errors.</p>
							<p>This implementation, combined with the acceleration in the development of bionic joints and neural links, practically sets the stage for the last great race of humanity: The Cyber Connective. Already there are a plethora of organizations working on this; however, there are a few current debates regarding the long-term impact. Concerns based around the security of implants and the idea of robot autonomy leading to them attempting to eliminate humans are at the top of the agenda (Solon, 2017). Should humanity wish to advance its development in this field, it will first be required to establish global limitations on robotic function or create a universal united stance on the matter.</p>
							<p>The success rate of robotic advancement, like anything, is measured in numbers. Successes versus failures define every industry with no exception. Already the da Vinci surgical System which incorporates human piloting and robotic precision has proven that enhanced robotic surgery is wildly successful. At one hospital alone, over ten thousand operations were performed in eight years using their four da Vinci system. Out of the total surgeries performed, the mortality rate was 12 or 0.12% if you will (Yonsei Medical Journal, 2018). As robots such as the STAR system are refined and dispersed full scale, it will quickly become apparent just how successful surgeries can be when human error is eliminated.</p>
							<p>Overall it is fair to say that the long term impact of these technologies is a substantial improvement in the quality of life for quite a significant number of people which is what any innovator should aspire to accomplish.</p>
							<p>Previously there was a collective who bemoaned the development of machinery and automation due to the belief it would eliminate the need for humans; it did not. Sixty years later and humanity are once again faced with the challenge to thrive to survive. The removal of danger-based or precision-based jobs will allow the masses to focus more closely on the issues which are more pressing such as medical development, environmental protection and space travel.</p>
							<p>Those whose jobs are made redundant can re-appropriate their skills where necessary. For example, machines will always need maintenance, patients will need someone to care for them, and the world will continue turning as it still has.</p>
							<p>This author welcomes the impending developments although is somewhat cautious due to having been raised with the releases of films such as Terminator and I-Robot. With the right limitations, intelligence structure and implementation, this writer believe that robotics will allow humanity to unlock its true potential without the hindrance of monotonous or dangerous jobs. Ultimately nothing would be different in the day to day life if anything it would be more exciting getting to interact with and develop faster, better and stronger biotics or robots.</p>
