							<h3>How is Robotics improving our lives?</h3>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>
								At present, robotics is defined as the design, creation, operation and automation of
								machines (Merriam-Webster Incorporated, 2020). This industry can be divided clearly into two
								main branches of industry and innovation. Industry focuses on the movement to automate the
								more dangerous jobs involved in manufacturing to reduces injuries, fatalities and insurance
								premiums. In contrast, the second branch of innovation is the movement to test the
								capabilities of creation to create an autonomous or sentient being. In essence, it is
								humanities effort to play god in their respect. This essay is innovation-focused.</p>
						</div>
	
						<div>
							<p>
								At this present time, state of the art robotics focuses mostly on the creation of Artificial
								Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning functionality and Bionics. The masterworks currently
								being done in these fields all have one thing in common, and that is the desire to replicate
								vital human functions.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>
								Efforts to create agile and calculative robots such as the nimble robotic hands created by
								Open AI (Wiggers, 2018), the terrain traipsing Atlas from Boston Dynamics (Markoff, 2013)
								and the bionic limbs of the MIT Center of Extreme Bionics (Herr, 2014) have all
								significantly advanced the understanding of human function. To date, they are yet to close
								the divide between biotic and robotic, meaning that there is room for further development. 
							</p>
						</div>
	
						<div>
							<p>
								Perhaps one of the most significant scientific undertakings at the moment is the aim to
								create and implant a functional neural link to utilize the inactive parts of the human
								brain. The current project NeuralLink project launched by one of the Tesla founder Elon Musk
								has brought a spotlight on this technology and created a demand for competent staff from a
								variety of specialties to develop it further (Lopatto, 2019).
							</p>
						</div>
	
						<div>
							<p>
								In the future, humanities next significant objective will likely be to make sophisticated
								neural links available to the masses to help the population achieve its unrecognized
								processing potential. Currently, the first examples are only available to people with
								hearing aids or Parkinson's patients with deep brain stimulation implants (The Michael J Fox
								Foundation, 2020). The developments to date have significantly reduced the size and invasive
								nature of this device.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>
								It is believed that through tissue sculpting and a shift in the amputation methods utilized
								globally, within the next few years, MIT will be able to create artificial proprioceptive
								joints and refine neurological embodiment. This process is still in trial stages but already
								shows promising results (Herr, 2018). It is from this point that once consistent
								neurological embodiment is achieved, the need for a brain-machine interface (BMI) to action
								the limb will become somewhat unnecessary.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>
								 In regards to the development of autonomous individual robotic units, advances in
								intelligent hardware functions which have taken place this year alone have cut image
								recognition time by a significant magnitude. This will enable future robots to analyses
								their obstacles quicker and have real-time reflexes (Vienna Institute of Technology , 2020).
								Although this seems like a small step, were this combined with the work being done by Boston
								Dynamics, it would create a search and rescue robot capable of evaluating hazards and risk
								in real-time, enhancing the capabilities of it to save lives if it were deployed.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>
								Were robotics to undergo this sort of rapid development within the next few years, it would
								open up doors in countless other industries. The Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) being
								implemented at the Boston Children's Hospital in the past year, learning how to do heart
								surgery, is a prime example (Svoboda, 2019). It is estimated that over time as it is taught
								more complex procedures requiring nanometer correct accuracy, it could save the 200,000
								lives lost annually in the United States of America due to physician errors.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>
								This implementation, combined with the acceleration in the development of bionic joints and
								neural links, practically sets the stage for the last great race of humanity: The Cyber
								Connective. Already there are a plethora of organizations working on this; however, there
								are a few current debates regarding the long-term impact. Concerns based around the security
								of implants and the idea of robot autonomy leading to them attempting to eliminate humans
								are at the top of the agenda (Solon, 2017). Should humanity wish to advance its development
								in this field, it will first be required to establish global limitations on robotic function
								or create a universal united stance on the matter.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>
								The success rate of robotic advancement, like anything, is measured in numbers. Successes
								versus failures define every industry with no exception. Already the da Vinci surgical
								System which incorporates human piloting and robotic precision has proven that enhanced
								robotic surgery is wildly successful. At one hospital alone, over ten thousand operations
								were performed in eight years using their four da Vinci system. Out of the total surgeries
								performed, the mortality rate was 12 or 0.12% if you will (Yonsei Medical Journal, 2018). As
								robots such as the STAR system are refined and dispersed full scale, it will quickly become
								apparent just how successful surgeries can be when human error is eliminated.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>
								Overall it is fair to say that the long term impact of these technologies is a substantial
								improvement in the quality of life for quite a significant number of people which is what
								any innovator should aspire to accomplish.
							</p>
						</div>
	
						<div>
							<p>
								Previously there was a collective who bemoaned the development of machinery and automation
								due to the belief it would eliminate the need for humans; it did not. Sixty years later and
								humanity are once again faced with the challenge to thrive to survive. The removal of
								danger-based or precision-based jobs will allow the masses to focus more closely on the
								issues which are more pressing such as medical development, environmental protection and
								space travel.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>
								Those whose jobs are made redundant can re-appropriate their skills where necessary. For
								example, machines will always need maintenance, patients will need someone to care for them,
								and the world will continue turning as it still has.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>
								This author welcomes the impending developments although is somewhat cautious due to having
								been raised with the releases of films such as Terminator and I-Robot. With the right
								limitations, intelligence structure and implementation, this writer believe that robotics
								will allow humanity to unlock its true potential without the hindrance of monotonous or
								dangerous jobs. Ultimately nothing would be different in the day to day life if anything it
								would be more exciting getting to interact with and develop faster, better and stronger
								biotics or robots.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>
								The personal financial impact could be quite significant, as well as the overall cost of
								ownership especially in combination with CaaS could induce quite a substantial cost saving,
								especially if the service is shared with multiple individuals within the household. Combine
								this with the potential to participate in services such as RoboTaxi it does provide an
								interesting finical outcome for all involved.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>
								Another factor to consider with autonomous vehicles is if widespread adoption does take
								place the potential impact it can have on our road and transportation network. As autonomous
								vehicles will be able to communicate with each other and their environments, not only will
								there be drastically fewer accidents on the road, but the flow of traffic should also see
								drastic improvements. Suggestions for a potential 35% increase in traffic flow rates through
								corporative driving show a substantial potential positive outcome. (Hyldmar N, He Y, &
								Prorok A 2019) Simply spending fewer times commuting and more times at our desired
								destination is a reality all of us would happily take on.
