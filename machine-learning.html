							<h3>How is Machine Learning improving our lives?</h3>
							<p>Machine learning, unlike code which has predetermined instructions sets, learning works with two main frameworks - supervised learning, where an algorithm will use a set of pre-defined known data inputs and known data outputs and trains and algorithmic model to generate responses and predictions (MathWorks n.d, para. 4). Unsupervised machine learning, ‘finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data; this draws inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labelled responses’ (MathWorks n.d, para. 7).</p>
							<p>The focus with machine learning is accuracy, to solve the problem at hand as efficiently as possible with a high degree of reliability. A great example of this is when Google Deep Mind defeated the world champion Go player in 2017 (Reynolds M 2017, para 1). While only winning by the smallest possible margin of half a point it is critical to remember the algorithm will proceed with the most reliable way to achieve the result, not the most dominating(Reynolds M 2017, para 2).</p>
							<p>The field of machine learning is vast. Thus, to distinguish a single platform as the single most advances are unquantifiable. Some of the biggest plays in the space from a medical, scientific and business application perspective are Google Cloud Ai Adventures, Azure machine learning studio and Amazon AWS. They are providing extremely sophisticated cloud-based machine learning infrastructure and software to consumers. Another field of significant contribution to machine learning is the development of autonomous vehicles. The likes of Tesla, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Nvidia have pushed machine learning algorithms within vehicles to provide publicly available level two autonomous vehicles. Finally, the perspective of quantum machine learning, Googles Quantum Computing division, Rigetti Computing, IBM, Cambridge Quantum Computing, MBR and QbitLogic (Quora 2018, para. 2) are all contributing significant milestones to the progression of unsupervised machine learning development.</p>
							<p>Over the short-term future, one of the most significant fundamental changes is a paradigm shift in the way machine learning, learns. Currently, the vast majority of machine learning operates under a principle we know of as supervised learning. The most significant limitation of supervised learning algorithms is the ability to apply them to different scenarios. For example, if we had an algorithm built to recognise images of cats, we would have to label thousands of pictures of cats in a data set for it to understand how to identify one. Now if we would like to use that same program to identify a dog, we would have to retrain the algorithm from the start (Forbes Insight 2019, para 2). In supervised learning, the machine infers a function from a set of training examples. In unsupervised learning, the machine tries to find hidden structure in unlabelled data’ (Lioyd S, Mohseni M & Rebentrost P 2013 p.1). The progression and simplification of unsupervised machine learning backed by quantum computing will be the most significant leap forward in the coming years for machine learning.</p>
							<p>As mentioned above, an enabling factor for the progression of unsupervised learning. Thus, machine learning is quantum computers. Fortunately, while everyday quantum computers are still many years if not decades, there is significant progress in this field development. In late 2019, Google was able to push through the boundaries of a significant milestone known as quantum supremacy, taking a computational task that would have taken the ‘world’s fastest supercomputer 10,000 years completed in under 3 minutes’ (Nature 2019, para. 1).</p>
							<p>Another significant, enabling technology for machine learning is the progression and development of cloud infrastructure. Machine learning leverages big data as fundamentally as it functions on data analysis. The level of data sets that need to be analysed, in some cases, reaches up to zettabytes in medical and scientific research (Chen Y et al. (2017)). The physical infrastructure available through data centres will be an essential factor with the potential to limit the progression of machine learning. As the field of data centres expands and become more efficient, machine learning will, in turn, progress.</p>
							<p>The direct future impact of machine learning is one that is difficult to quantify; this is mainly because machine learning by nature is a vast field; and is the application of machine learning which will determine its impact. The theoretical impact and application long term to machine learning and artificial intelligence is limitless. In the short term, one of the most significant impacts of machine learning is its application in medicine. Doctors stand out through their ability to manage big data to gain an understanding of their patients. Computing behaviour, physiology, laboratory testing and imagery studies, through to omic data (Emmanuel E & Obermeyer Z 2016, para. 12). The role of machine learning to aid doctors in understanding their patients medically to higher degrees of accuracy will optimistically become ever apparent in the not too distant future.</p>
							<p>Another field that is developing at accelerating rates utilising machine learning in combination with artificial intelligence is autonomous transportation. Using machine learning the capabilities of already publicly available vehicles are outstanding. Assuming development rates are sustained to reasonable levels in this field soon, we could potentially see publicly and commercial vehicles with level three, potentially level four autonomous driving capabilities.</p>
							<p>Investment from a time and resource perspective is astronomical in the space; currently, leading global companies are on the race to develop securing patents and IP. ‘IDC predicts worldwide spending on cognitive and Artificial Intelligence systems will reach $77.6B in 2022’ (Columbus L 2019, Parra. 1). The extradentary economic stimulus into the field has increased demand for machine learning engineers in 2019 for the US by over 340% (Indeed, 2019, para. 6). There will also be an associated increase in demand for infrastructure engineers and data scientist to assist in the research and development of technology. The negative side of this equation where the technology has the potential capacity to make jobs redundant through its application in autonomous vehicles, medical research, advertising, warehousing and scientific research.</p>
							<p>Machine learning will affect almost everyone, be it a direct impact on their life or indirect. Machine learning will be a piece of technology most will not even be aware they are engaging with; if it is by receiving better medical treatment, engaging with autonomous vehicles, interacting with voice assistant technology such as ‘Hey, Google’, or advertisement through social media channels such as Facebook and beyond. We will also see continual integration into business, through more capable and comparable software, publicly available machine learning-based analytics, and so forth.</p>
							<p>Machine learning will impact my personal life in many ways. Currently, like almost everyone, algorithms pushing advertisement through social media channels have an impact on one’s life. Targeted advertisement for better or worse is a constant reminder of the potential associated with machine learning technology. Another impact is through engagement with voice assistant technology. ‘Hey, Google’ has become a very comparable and viable piece of technology which I engage with regularly. Having Google Homes throughout the house and being on a google device significantly enhances the integration of this technology around me, and the association it has within my daily life.</p>
							<p>From a professional perspective, there are two primary ways I engage with machine learning. The first is through our advertising structure; we achieve a significant amount of our advertising through Google advertisement systems. There is a substantial resource investment from myself with reverse-engineering the algorithms to understand how and why the machine learning code operates the way it does, allowing us to tailor our advertisement to the algorithms ensuring the best result.</p>
							<p>The second is primarily through sales data analytics, looking at sell-out and sell-through data. Using AWS machine learning analytic tools to distinguish meaningful trends from the sales data, and has become a fundamental part of the workflow. Driver-based forecasting, budgeting and customer relations.</p>
							<p>In years to come, the most significant impact of Machine learning on my family and I will most likely, be the ever-present introduction of autonomous vehicles and CaaS. The vehicles will change the way my family both commute and how we financially engage with vehicles.</p>
							<p>A more progressive impact will be on our phones and computers. We are already starting to see machine learning algorithms trickle into the operating systems of both personal computers and phones. While this will not be such a drastic change in comparison to the likes of autonomous vehicles, the incremental improvements to the way we interact and the feature sets with these devices is hardly negligible.</p>
