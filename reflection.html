					<h3>Individual Reflections</h3>
					<p><strong>Beau - </strong><i>"Working with Team #IDK-5 has been one of my greatest pleasures of group collaboration. I want to personally thank everyone for their contributions, and communication over the past assignment. This assignment has clearly demonstrated that the team members of this group aim for not just academic success, but also aspire to become highly motivated individuals with a promising career ahead of them in Information Technology. I don’t believe that one person had felt that their workload was either too much. This was perfect demonstration of an effective team with unification in mind. I look forward the next time that I get the opportunity to work with them."</i></p>
					<p><strong>Jacob - </strong><i>"It was great to see the level of teamwork within the group. The willingness to divide work, communicate ideas and work with constructive criticism was refreshing. All involved helped to develop ideas, proofread and pear review each other work to help improve the content submitted and provide different perspectives to the topic at hand. It is also worth noting we unfortunately lost two members of our team through out the project, the ability for everyone to regroup and reassign work to ensure everything was completed on time was great to see by all. Clear direction was assigned throughout the assignment and outlined responsibilities to all. Everyone was accountable for the sections they where assigned and helped each other to achieve their tasks. Overall the group was great to work with, high levels of communication and regular catchup helped to ensure we were able to complete the assignment to a high standard. Very pleased and happy with the overall group effort."</i></p>
					<p><strong>James - </strong><i>"Working with our team was an absolute delighted to experience to work on this assignment. One of the real standouts was the fact that there was excellent communication, input, feedback and interest. Larissa, Beau and Jacob are all dedicated to learning and achieving high standards. There was equal accountability initiated by our team, control of the situation, nominated for tasks, checked in on other team members, and did their bit to lead the team in the right direction. One of the things I have learned in life is constructive criticism is a vital attribute; our team put that on display superbly. The successful communication and collaboration could be associated with maturity as much as the way our team has developed teamwork within our careers. IDK-5 is Innovative, Dedicated, Knowledgeable and 5uccessful."</i></p>
					<p><strong>Larissa - </strong><i>"As a group, IDK-5 surpassed all expectations. Having been hindered by the loss of two members both at the beginning and midway through the assessment, it was quite impressive to witness how the team came together to ensure that they reached their objective. There were no complaints when work was reassigned, quite the opposite actually. Everyone rallied to ensure that no one team member was overwhelmed by their work load. If anything, the team was constantly asking if there was something they could do to be of assistance. There was a spectacular amount of accountability within the group, each member providing constant updates in regards to the progress of their allotted work to ensure they met the required deadlines. Each report and section were checked over to ensure it was concise and grammatically accurate but most importantly that it met the strict, high standard that our group had established. This group was a perfect example of communication, dedication and consideration. IDK-5 has set the bar quite high for the expectations that will be carried into future group projects."</i></p>
					<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
					<p>Team #IDK-5 as a collective, was a fantastic learning experience. From completing the assignment to assisting each other, where skillsets faced challenges, and learning opportunities arose, it was a tremendous experience for all involved. A few of us have already started to reach out to each other in other media platforms, such as Linkedin.</p>
					<p>While the experience was enjoyable, it did come with its fair share of trials and tribulations. Early and midway throughout the assignment, Team #IDK-5 had lost two of its members, requiring that the workload be re-assigned. In light of this new workload, we knew we needed to be dynamic and discussed together that the best approach was to have individually assigned responsibilities for segmented tasks.</p>
					<p>What we found quite surprising was how proactive we all were when work needed to be re-assigned or collaborated on and had been done with non-existent resistance. Many of us have said that they had worked in other group work where the desired result had not occurred, and communication within the team had broken down.</p>
					<p>The frequent feedback provided amongst team members was how proud each of us was of the quality of the project had been delivered and of each other's willingness to get this completed.</p>
					<p>We found in particular that despite all being separate personality types, traits and backgrounds, we all worked quite well, despite the initial conversation and feedback from the Team Profile at the start of the project.</p>
					<p>In hindsight, we are all looking forward to the next opportunity that we get to collaborate again with each other.</p>
