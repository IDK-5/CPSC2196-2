					<h3>Individual Reflections</h3>
					<p><strong>Beau - </strong> <i>"..."</i></p>
					<p><strong>Jacob - </strong> <i>"It was great to see the level of teamwork within the group. The willingness to divide work, communicate ideas and work with constructive criticism was refreshing. All involved helped to develop ideas, proofread and pear review each other work to help improve the content submitted and provide different perspectives to the topic at hand.<br />It is also worth noting we unfortunately lost two members of our team through out the project, the ability for everyone to regroup and reassign work to ensure everything was completed on time was great to see by all. Clear direction was assigned throughout the assignment and outlined responsibilities to all. Everyone was accountable for the sections they where assigned and helped each other to achieve their tasks.<br />Overall the group was great to work with, high levels of communication and regular catchup helped to ensure we were able to complete the assignment to a high standard. Very pleased and happy with the overall group effort."</i></p>
					<p><strong>James - </strong> <i>""</i></p>
					<p><strong>Larissa - </strong> <i>"As a group, IDK-5 surpassed all expectations. Having been hindered by the loss of two members both at the beginning and midway through the assessment, it was quite impressive to witness how the team came together to ensure that they reached their objective. There were no complaints when work was reassigned, quite the opposite actually. Everyone rallied to ensure that no one team member was overwhelmed by their work load. If anything, the team was constantly asking if there was something they could do to be of assistance."<br />There was a spectacular amount of accountability within the group, each member providing constant updates in regards to the progress of their allotted work to ensure they met the required deadlines. Each report and section were checked over to ensure it was concise and grammatically accurate but most importantly that it met the strict, high standard that our group had established.<br />This group was a perfect example of communication, dedication and consideration. IDK-5 has set the bar quite high for the expectations that will be carried into future group projects.</i></p>
